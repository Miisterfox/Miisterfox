# About me

I am a 20 years old computer science student currently located in Paris, France.
Since my youngest age, I love learning new things and getting passionnate with about anything I discover.

To this day, Art (in a very general manner) and Computer Science are the two fields in which I thrive. 

## What I am currently working on

- Building the first version of a website for a french painter and illustrator using Svelte and Typescript. It's primary use will be showcasing the artist work and the news related to her.

- Building another website for a yearly hackathon "Bourse Coddity" with one goal : making the IPCC's climate reports as accessible as possible through various means (Dataviz, Interactive maps, etc.). Started using threejs to build a 3d interactable website (Other technologies are to be decided)
