# About me

23 years old currently living in Nagoya, Japan for a 6 months exchange program doing research.
I'll be studying satellite imagery for forest monitoring and accurate tree-specific detection using multi-source data.


Art (in a very general manner) and Computer Science are the two fields that nurture my ape brain. 🐒
