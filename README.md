# About me

I am a 20 years old computer science student currently located in Paris, France.
Since my youngest age, I love learning new things and getting passionnate with about anything I discover.

To this day, Art (in a very general manner) and Computer Science are the two fields in which I thrive. 

## What I am currently working on

- Building the first version of a website for a french painter and illustrator using Svelte and Typescript. It's primary use will be showcasing the artist work and the news related to her.
